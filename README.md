# AMP®-Parkinson's Disease Progression Prediction

The goal of this competition is to predict MDS-UPDR scores, which measure progression in patients with Parkinson's disease. The Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is a comprehensive assessment of both motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's. I will develop a model trained on data of protein and peptide levels over time in subjects with Parkinson’s disease versus normal age-matched control subjects.

This repo contains my code in Jupyter Notebooks with basic and extended EDA and the training of models.
